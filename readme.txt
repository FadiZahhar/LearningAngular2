First Try on angular2
In this example. I created an application with Angular 2. 
I explored Angular 2 and used its directives and bindings in our components. I also used an online API. 
I should now be able to build small Angular applications. In the comming examples, I will build a more complex application in Angular, which will also use its own server.
